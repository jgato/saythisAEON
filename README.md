# saythisAEON
Subscribe to an AEON's entity to say hello to received names. Just playing with docker to deploy containers with Rancher, resin.io, codeship, etc. 

*Important*: code based in [text2spech](https://github.com/resin-io/text2speech)

More info about AEON (a Cloud platform for Pub/Sub) [here](https://github.com/atos-ari-aeon/fiware-cloud-messaging-platform).

Data is received in a json like this:

```javascript
{
 "name": "Jose"
}

```

Other different document will say hello to unknown person.
